# Monte-Carlo-Simulations
Ising Model in Julia. Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0217v1

main.jl contains the code for the monte carlo simulations

ising_aux.jl contains the auxilary functions needed for the monte carlo simulations. (Used mainly for abstraction and ease of modification)

part_fun.jl contains the code for calculating the average energy axactly using the partition function

pi.jl is a test file for a poor man's paralellisation to calculate pi
